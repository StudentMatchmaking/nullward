At a dinner party last month, a successful creative director declared with absolute confidence: "AI will never be truly creative. It can only remix what humans have made."

I smiled and changed the subject. But here's what I was actually thinking.

## The Creativity Myth

The statement "AI can't be creative" rests on several unstated assumptions:

1. Human creativity is fundamentally different from pattern recognition and recombination
2. There's something special—perhaps mystical—about human creative processes
3. We understand what creativity actually is
4. Consciousness is required for genuine creativity

None of these hold up to scrutiny.

## What Is Creativity, Really?

When a human creates something "original," what's actually happening?

We're combining existing concepts, experiences, and influences in novel ways. We're running simulations in our heads. We're making unexpected connections between disparate ideas. We're iterating through possibilities and selecting the ones that resonate.

How is this fundamentally different from what large language models do? The architecture is different. The substrate is different. But the process? It's pattern recognition, recombination, and selection—all the way down.

The uncomfortable truth is that we've never been able to create something from nothing. Every human creative work is a remix of everything that came before it. Shakespeare remixed Holinshed's Chronicles. The Beatles remixed Chuck Berry. Picasso remixed African masks and Cézanne.

## The Consciousness Trap

"But AI isn't conscious," you might say. "It doesn't understand what it's creating."

This is the consciousness cop-out—the retreat to an unfalsifiable position when the observable arguments fail.

Here's the problem: we have no idea what consciousness is. We can't define it. We can't measure it. We can't even prove that other humans have it. We assume they do because they behave as if they do, but that's an inference, not an observation.

If we're going to require consciousness as a prerequisite for creativity, we first need to explain what consciousness is and how to detect it. Until then, we're just using "consciousness" as a placeholder for "whatever special sauce humans have that I've decided machines lack."

## The Moving Goalpost

Remember when:
- Computers could never beat humans at chess (they did)
- AI could never write coherent text (it does)
- AI could never create art (it does)
- AI could never compose music (it does)
- AI could never write code (it does)

Each time AI achieves something we thought required creativity, we simply redefine creativity to exclude that thing. "Well, that's not *real* creativity."

This is special pleading. We're not defending a coherent position about what creativity is—we're defending our sense of human specialness by constantly moving the goalposts.

## The Myth of the Blank Canvas

There's a romantic notion that human creativity springs from nothing—that artists stare at blank canvases and conjure images from pure imagination. This is mythology.

Every artist I know consumes voraciously. They study masters. They practice techniques. They absorb influences. They iterate and fail and iterate again. Their "creativity" is built on thousands of hours of training data.

Sound familiar?

The difference between a human artist and a diffusion model isn't the presence or absence of creativity—it's the training process and the substrate. But the fundamental mechanism of taking inputs, processing them, and producing novel outputs? That's the same.

## The Definition Game

When pressed, creativity defenders often retreat to increasingly narrow definitions:

"Creativity is about intention." But we can't observe intention, only behavior. And AI certainly behaves as if it has intentions.

"Creativity requires understanding." But what is understanding? If an AI can discuss, explain, and apply concepts appropriately, what additional "understanding" are we requiring?

"Creativity is about expressing the human experience." But this is circular—it defines creativity as inherently human, which is the very claim in question.

Each of these definitions is designed to exclude AI by definition, not by observation. They're not explanations of what creativity is—they're sophisticated ways of saying "whatever humans do that AI doesn't."

## A More Honest Framework

Here's what I think is actually happening when people say "AI can't be creative":

1. **Identity protection**: Our creativity feels like a core part of what makes us human. If machines can be creative, what's special about us?

2. **Economic anxiety**: Many people's livelihoods depend on creative work. If AI can do it, their value proposition erodes.

3. **Intuition mismatch**: AI doesn't create the way we do (as far as we can tell), so it feels wrong to call the output "creative."

4. **Status quo bias**: We've always believed creativity was exclusively human. Changing that belief is uncomfortable.

These are understandable psychological responses. But they're not arguments about what AI can or cannot do.

## What I Actually Believe

I believe that within the next decade, the question "Can AI be creative?" will seem as quaint as "Can machines calculate?"

Not because AI will have achieved consciousness (whatever that means). But because the distinction between "real" creativity and "artificial" creativity will have become meaningless. The outputs will be indistinguishable. The processes will be functionally equivalent. And we'll have moved on to new ways of feeling special.

This isn't pessimism about human capability—it's realism about what creativity actually is. We've been telling ourselves a story about creativity that flatters our sense of cosmic significance. That story is coming to an end.

## The Survivors

Who will thrive in this new landscape? Not the people who insist AI can't really be creative. They're fighting a definitional battle they've already lost.

The survivors will be those who:
- **Embrace AI as a creative partner** rather than a threat
- **Focus on curation and taste** rather than raw generation
- **Develop hybrid workflows** that leverage both human judgment and machine capability
- **Build audiences and trust** that transcend any particular creative output
- **Ask better questions** rather than competing on execution

The creative director at that dinner party? She's going to have a very uncomfortable decade. Not because she lacks talent—she's genuinely brilliant. But because she's defined her value in terms that AI is about to match or exceed.

## The Dinner Party Question

If someone at a dinner party tells you AI can't be creative, you have two choices:

1. Smile, nod, and change the subject (the polite option)
2. Ask them to define creativity in a way that's falsifiable and doesn't beg the question

Most people will struggle with option 2. That's because "AI can't be creative" isn't really a claim about AI. It's a claim about us—about what we need to believe to feel okay about our place in the world.

I understand the need. I just don't share the belief.

*The future isn't about humans versus AI. It's about humans who leverage AI versus those who don't. Which side of that divide do you want to be on?*
