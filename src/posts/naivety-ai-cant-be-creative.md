At a dinner party last month, a successful creative director declared with absolute confidence: "AI will never be truly creative. It can only remix what humans have made."

I smiled and changed the subject. But here's what I was actually thinking.

## The Creativity Myth

The statement "AI can't be creative" rests on several unstated assumptions:

1. Human creativity is fundamentally different from pattern recognition and recombination
2. There's something special—perhaps mystical—about human creative processes
3. We understand what creativity actually is

None of these hold up to scrutiny.

## What Is Creativity, Really?

When a human creates something "original," what's actually happening?

We're combining existing concepts, experiences, and influences in novel ways. We're running simulations in our heads. We're making unexpected connections between disparate ideas.

How is this fundamentally different from what large language models do? The architecture is different. The substrate is different. But the process?

## The Moving Goalpost

Remember when:
- Computers could never beat humans at chess (they did)
- AI could never write coherent text (it does)
- AI could never create art (it does)
- AI could never compose music (it does)

Each time, we moved the goalpost. "Okay, but *real* creativity is..."

At what point do we admit we're engaged in motivated reasoning? We *want* human creativity to be special. That doesn't make it so.

## The Uncomfortable Middle Ground

I'm not saying AI creativity is identical to human creativity. I'm saying the distinction is fuzzier than we want to admit.

And I'm saying that confident pronouncements about what AI "can never" do have aged very, very poorly.

## What This Means for Creatives

If your sense of professional identity rests on "creativity that AI can't replicate," you should stress-test that assumption hard.

What specifically can you do that AI can't? How long will that advantage last?

The creatives who thrive will be those who:
- Embrace AI as a tool rather than dismissing it as a threat
- Focus on taste, curation, and judgment—areas where human preference matters
- Build audiences who care about the human behind the work

## The Real Question

The real question isn't "can AI be creative?" It's "does the distinction matter for practical purposes?"

If an AI produces work that moves people, that solves problems, that opens new possibilities—does it matter whether we call that "creative"?

I suspect the answer reveals more about our need for human specialness than it does about the nature of creativity.

And that's what I couldn't say at that dinner party.
