This is the take I'd never post under my real name. It's too politically charged, too easily misinterpreted, and too uncomfortable for polite company.

But I believe it's true: we are witnessing the high-water mark of human employment, and the tide is going out.

## The Standard Narrative Is Wrong

The optimistic narrative goes like this: technology has always created more jobs than it destroyed. The agricultural revolution. The industrial revolution. The computer revolution. Each time, we found new things for humans to do.

This time is different. And not in the way past techno-pessimists were wrong.

## What Makes AI Different

Previous technologies augmented human physical or computational abilities. AI augments—and increasingly replaces—human *cognitive* abilities.

There's a fundamental asymmetry here. When machines replaced muscle, humans moved to brain work. When machines replace brain work, where do humans move?

The answer isn't obvious. And "new jobs we can't imagine yet" isn't an argument—it's a hope.

## The Timeline

I don't think this happens overnight. My rough estimate:

- **2026-2028**: White-collar productivity gains mask job losses
- **2028-2030**: Unemployment starts visibly rising despite economic growth
- **2030-2035**: Political crisis as traditional employment drops below 50%
- **2035+**: New equilibrium, probably involving UBI or equivalent

## What I'm Doing About It

I'm not sharing this to be nihilistic. I'm sharing it because I think clear-eyed assessment is the first step to adaptation.

Personally, I'm:
- Building skills in areas where human judgment still matters
- Investing in community and relationships
- Creating assets that generate value independent of my labor
- Supporting policy discussions around economic transition

The future isn't written. But pretending everything will be fine isn't a strategy.

## The Uncomfortable Truth

Here's what I can't say in professional settings: if you're planning a 30-year career in a field that involves processing information, pattern recognition, or creating content, you should have a backup plan.

Not because you're not valuable. Because the economics are about to shift in ways we've never seen.

I hope I'm wrong. I don't think I am.
