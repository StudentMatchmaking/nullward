Here's a prediction I'd never post on LinkedIn: the vast majority of today's tech companies are already dead—they just don't know it yet.

## The Moat Problem

For decades, tech companies built moats around:
- **Proprietary algorithms** — AI commoditizes these overnight
- **Data advantages** — synthetic data and public datasets close the gap
- **Engineering talent** — AI coding assistants level the playing field
- **Distribution** — attention is fragmenting faster than ever

What's left?

## Community Is the Only Moat

The companies that survive will be the ones that build genuine human connection. Not "engagement metrics." Not "active users." Real communities where people feel belonging.

This isn't soft thinking. It's the hardest moat to build and the only one AI can't replicate.

## The Math Is Brutal

Consider a typical SaaS company with:
- 50 engineers at $200k average = $10M/year
- Product, design, marketing = another $5M
- Infrastructure and overhead = $3M

That's $18M to build and maintain a product.

Now imagine:
- 3 people with AI-augmented development
- Infrastructure costs dropping 90% annually
- Marketing automated by AI agents

The cost to replicate any software product is approaching zero. The only question is: do people *want* to be part of what you're building?

## What This Means

If you're building a company, stop asking "what features do we need?" Start asking "what community are we creating?"

If you're investing, stop looking at ARR growth. Start looking at community health metrics.

If you're working at a tech company, honestly assess: is this company building something AI can't replicate? If not, start planning your exit.

The clock is ticking.
